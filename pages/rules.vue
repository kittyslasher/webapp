          <br>

          <div>
              <p>You let me stuck in a computer game 25 years ago just to receive a ticket for a boat trip you didn’t even take. (And guess what, Mew wasn’t behind that bus either).</p>
              <p>25 years man! It took you 25 years to finally have something that can be called an internet, - yeah, not that creepy Web 2.0.  you had before - and the tech so I could finally complete the digitalisation of all Pokémon through crypto and bring them to my online world. I can finally be free with the ones I love but I can’t take care of them all so I’m giving you a chance to catch and train them like you’ve always wanted to.</p>
              <p>All 1st gen Pokémon are already here as NFTs in the MATIC world and they will be out there in the wild for you to catch them.</p>
              <p>Well, isn’t that obvious you ungrateful fucks?! I’m setting free those 151 bastards you’ve all loved to collect in many different forms and shapes for the past 20 years in the crypto world, so you can finally collect them in a way that makes sense to your purse and doesn’t get thrown to trash by your momma on moving day.</p>
              <p>After that, you can train them, teach them new skills, equip, trade and battle them. But let’s get it started slowly, follow my lead:</p>
